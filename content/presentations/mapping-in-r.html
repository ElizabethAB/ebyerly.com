                        This presentation will be useful and interesting if you do not know R. Knowing R will help you follow the code examples, but the content is geared toward:
                        <ul>
                            <li>considerations relevant to map graphics generally, and</li>
                            <li>showcasing the tools in R available to you whenever you have a relevant use case.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The code included on the slides does not fully reproduce all graphics (it focuses on the map graphic commands and omits visual tweaks). Please refer to the linked <a href="https://github.com/ElizabethAB/mapping_in_r">Github page</a> for the full code.

                        These two maps fall into traps. The left is a punchline, but the right is a typical mistake: using an ordered visual, one color hue along scaled saturation and values, to represent categorical values.
                        <br>
                        Intuitive maps use visual pre-attentive variables: location, size, transparency, texture, color value/hue/saturation, orientation, and shape. Which to use depends on whether your data is quantitative, ordered, categorical, associated, or disassociated. These are general graphic rules; they do not change because you're on a map.
                        <br>
                        The best test for a map, as with any graphic, is to show it to someone outside your current project and confirm they can parse out the meaning.

                        One of the main reasons we use map graphics, even when a bar graph really would show the same information, is that it is visually compelling. We attach significance to the image as more "real" and we can double down on this irrational inflation of importance by making the graphic attractive.

                        R is free, the packages on which this presentation relies are free, they are open source (meaning we can look at the code to confirm it does what we intend, as can the entire R community), and there is a large body of active R users online offering tutorials, advice, and troubleshooting help.
                        <br>
                        Most importantly: R can produce map graphics which are informative and attractive entirely through reproducible code (as opposed to relying on post-processing in Paint or Photoshop). This is an important standard for data analysis.

                        You will not be making this map at the end of today, as it relies on extending on the ggplot2 graphical library (and a good design sense). Consider it aspirational.

                        <br>
                        `qmap()` means "quick map" from the `ggmap` package. It's an easy-to-use abstraction of the `get_map()` and `ggmap()` functions (about which more later). We feed it an address, a lat-lon set, or a bounding box, and it returns a raster map. In our case, it automagically geocodes a provided address.
                        <br>
                        A map on its own is a <b>reference</b> map (like we have here) or a <b>topographic</b> map (if we had pulled up a map showing hills, valleys, and bodies of water). What we care about as analysts are <b>thematic</b> maps which overlay information above the spatial and topographic features. You cannot call a map of London an "infographic," not even if it has streets, but you CAN if you visually encode those streets with traffic densities during rush hour.

                        `qmap()` returns a map, `qmplot()` returns a map plot. The `qmplot()` function will use the bounding box values of the x and y mapped values to automatically source a raster map, (the image of Washington DC with a bit of Union Station), and can be used to produce simple graph types like this dot point map.
                        <br>
                        Note we use the `geocode()` function, which returns longitude and latitude variable values identifying the location of the address provided.

                        The best source of raster maps is the "ggmaps" package: it is easy to use, well documented, flexible, and created by two respected R developers (Wickham and Kahle). 
                        <br>
                        There is no best source for vector maps, but here are two starting recommendations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>EDA: "maps" and "choroplethr" packages. Easy-to-use datasets for common use cases like the globe, US states/counties, many more. Their weakness is how frequently their maps are updated (there is an apocryphal tale of the analyst mapping Europe and finding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia proudly represented).</li>
                            <li>Production: it is straightforward to load shapefiles from trusted sources (e.g., US Census) into R. We will show an example of how this can be done.</li>

                        How did we make this map?
                        <br>
                        First, we pull in a dataset from the `maps` package. 
                        <br>
                        We establish a ggplot object using data from the world object (a dataframe from the "maps" package, which tracks ordered latitude and longitude points tracing the outlines of nations grouped by a categorical variable), defining the aesthetic mappings of x to longitude, y to latitude, and group to group (the value used to track which points belong to which nations). The next line adds a geom layer using the polygon statistic: this uses the group aesthetic to trace contained spaces. The fill color is set to region, a categorical variable in the world dataframe, so ggplot will automatically try to apply appropriate colors to make the regions distinct (it does not work perfectly for data like this, you can notice a few instances where similar colors are adjacent, but the rules assigning color values can be adjusted as part of generating a finished product).
                        <br>
                        There is a problem with this quick-and-dirty map: can you find the Caspian Sea or the Great Lakes?
                        <br>
                        An important note for now and moving forward: the R code displayed is a minimal representation of that required to produce the graphic shown. The focus is on the functions and options needed to produce the map. We want to focus on the mapping code, not the housekeeping code that suppresses legends or axis ticks. The full code used to produce these graphics is available: <a href="https://github.com/ElizabethAB/mapping_in_r">ElizabethAB/mapping_in_r</a></li>.

                        <em>Projections are important to understanding maps, but are a complicated topic we won't cover thoroughly. In brief, map projections are mathematical transformations of a sphere to a flat plane representation and they necessarily trade off accuracy of angle, size, and relation. Different projection classes are better for accurately representing different latitudes (azimuthal for polar, cylindrical for equatorial, and conic for middle-latitude areas).</em>

                        Shapefiles are an industry-standard format for storing spatial relationships data. They rely on multiple individual files on disk in a shared folder and connected by a common base name (in this example, cb_2014_us_county_500k).
                        <br>
                        Reading a shapefile into R is not difficult, but it is more involved than the methods we have so far reviewed. We use the `readOGR()` function from the "rgdal" package (an R interface to the geospatial data abstraction library GDAL) to identify the folder containing our shapefile set and the common name.
                        <br>
                        We can use the same code from our previous slide, but using US census shapefiles gives us a better resolution and more confidence that the graphic represents current accepted boundaries.
