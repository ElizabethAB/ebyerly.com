<h1 style="font-family: Consolas" class="center" id="randloop"></h1>

A pseudo-random number generator is an algorithm that deterministically
produces a series of numbers designed to mimic a random series.

Pseudo-random numbers are valuable for simulations, statistics, mathematics,
and encryption.

???

True random number generators:
* dice,
* roulette wheel,
* a stumbling drunk.

A true random number generator cannot be reproducible! As statisticians, a
*good* PRNG is preferred to a RNG.

The development of PRNGs was kickstarted by the need for reusable random values
for physics simulations.

A simple, terrible PRNG, used by Von Neumann in initial simulations for
developing thermonuclear weapons. (He appreciated the fact the terribleness
ensured no one "forgot" it was a PRNG and treated its outputs as true random.)

PRNGs are an iterated map, chaotic but never genuinely random.

It's a short list, but it is important to 100% of my current professional work.

Numbers that are systematically non-random introduce bias to statistical
analysis. If the series we use as random numbers show non-random qualities, we
will produce wrong answers.

In the next four slides, we're going to cover the basics of using PRNGs for
statistical analysis.

This doesn't answer, what's the best PRNG? It answers,
what do I need to understand about different PRNGs, my use case, and returning
to my work to use PRNGs effectively?

The table shows four statistical software tools and their default PRNG
(beginning of 2016). This is the most basic question: what PRNG am I using if
I am using the default functions of a language?

The last column indicates how alternative PRNGs can be introduced: simplest is 
if they are built in as an option, often available as an extension through the 
tool's installation system, ultimately always available if you take the time to 
write out the algorithm yourself. 

All of these systems have changed the PRNG they use at some point. Stata 14 uses
Mersenne-Twister, for instance. Stay up to date on your software of choice!

SAS does not have built-in alternatives. Many of SAS's random functions are 
underpinned by a PRNG other than Mersenne-Twister (functions using this older 
version include UNIFORM, NORMAL, and functions beginning with RAN*). SAS's 
documentation suggests strongly against using these functions, ie a deprecated 
feature, so I don't list it as a built-in alternative.

Back to, Stata 13 uses KISS and Stata 14 uses Mersenne-Twister. Whether a
system is using 32-bit or 64-bit backend storage will change value sequences.
Knowing where your system was when you ran a file is key for reproducing it in
the future!

Of course you'll know your seed for each run, because of your log file. Because
you always generate a log file. Right?

Pick your seed well and randomly. You can look at your system's provided seed
value or call your PRNG once and use those values as seeds. Or, the practice of
using that day's date is not bad - but, of course you shouldn't do this for
multiple related analyses started on the same day!

In Python, you cannot use `random.seed()` with the value returned by
`random.getstate()`. You provide the seed state to `random.setstate()`.

Do not set your seed too frequently. Setting the seed before each draw means you
are using the seed value passed through the algorithm, which isn't even pseudo-
random.

The SAS command is part of a data process. Providing it 0 as an argument will
have the computer uses its clock to initialize the stream.

???

If your use case is sensitive to the quality and kind of PRNG (it usually is),
do your homework and know what your software is using when you ask it for random
numbers!

ONE
<br>
In the first case, a PRNG with a short period is more than sufficient. In the
second, you are taking 10^9 samples. The period is relevant.
The distinct sequences produced by a PRNG is limited by the sequence's period.
Rule of thumb: if you need n random values, you need a PRNG with a cycle length
of n^2

TWO
<br>
Local system can use a single seed. Remote system needs a seed for each process,
but providing the same seed means all processes using the same sequence! You
can encounter this when telling cluster nodes to use the system time as a seed
value if any start at the same time (more likely as more nodes are used).

THREE
<br>
Any sufficiently random PRNG can handle returning a 0 or a 1. They cover limited
space, however, and may not represent the granularity in the space between 0 and
1 your use case requires.

## {{ name }}

**Period**: the length of the sequence of numbers the PRNG can generate before
it must start repeating.

**Randomness**: whether the values produced by the PRNG match with qualities
known to be satisfied by true random number generators.

**Efficiency**: the computational burden of calling the PRNG.

???

Period

* The reported period of a PRNG is not the period you will get. The actual
  period will depend on the seed value. Depending on the complexity and kind of
  your PRNG, knowing the period of a given seed entails stepping through all
  produced values until the end is encountered.
* The maximum period length for a PRNG depends on how the computer represents
  its state; the period is less than or equal to 2^b (bits!)
* Mersenne-Twister has a period of 2^32 - 1, but the likelihood of a duplicate
  value in 10^5 draws is more than 50%.

Randomness

* Can it be used to approximate pi?
* Does it return a balanced number of odd and even values?

Efficiency

* How much memory does the PRNG require? (2Kb is considered a lot...)
* How many processing cycles does a new drawn value require to produce?

???

Multiple streams of random numbers, in the case of L'Ecuyer, is more valuable
than providing an individual stream to each process because the one algorithm's
streams never get into sync.

KISS example code:
```
static unsigned int x = 123456789,y = 362436000,z = 521288629,c = 7654321; /* Seed variables */ unsigned int KISS()
{ unsigned long long t, a = 698769069ULL;
x = 69069*x+12345; y ^= (y<<13); y ^= (y>>17); y ^= (y<<5); /* y must never be set to zero! */ t = a*z+c; c = (t>>32); /* Also avoid setting z=c=0! */
return x+y+(z=t); }
```

IBM's `randu` produces directly correlated values in sequence.

C `rand()` produces alternatively odd and even numbers

Javascript's `Math.random()` will likely produce duplicate values after only 30k
draws.

Microsoft's `libc` generator has a period of 32k, meaning you'll be playing the
same game of Solitaire (from the same deck shuffle) after only 214 games.

Many systems can take advantage of a random number generator: you.

Random numbers are unpredictable, uniform on some range, uncorrelated, minimum
information for maximum entropy, impossible to generate.

We will almost never use these for statistics because we almost always want to
be able to reproduce our analysis.

`/dev/random` uses hardware timings to produce (record?) entropy.

Diehard George Marsaglia 1996

Dieharder Robert Brown 2016 (actively developed)

Dieharder is an expansion on Marsaglia's original suite, actively developed and
implementing the Statistical Test Suite provided by NIST.

A few examples of easily understood (relatively) tests from Diehard:

* Birthday spacings: Choose random points on a large interval and observe how
  closely the spacing matches exponential distribution. The name is based on the
  birthday paradox.
* Overlapping permutations: Analyze sequences of five consecutive random
  numbers: the 120 possible orderings should occur with statistically equal
  probability.
* Minimum distance test: Randomly place 8,000 points in a 10,000 x 10,000
  square, find the minimum distance between the pairs, and the square of the
  minimum distance should be exponentially distributed with a certain mean.
* The squeeze test: Multiply 231 by random floats on (0,1) until you reach 1.
  Repeat this 100,000 times. The number of floats needed to reach 1 should
  follow a certain distribution.
* Runs test: Generate a long sequence of random floats on (0,1). Count ascending
  and descending runs. The counts should follow a certain distribution.

Cryptologically Secure PRNGs are used for encryption.

A good CSPRNG is a good PRNG, but a PRNG may not satisfy CSPRNG requirements.

???

* key-pair - as in, SSH
* nonces - pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure
  that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks
* one-time pads - a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred
  to as a one-time pad). Each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by
  combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad. If the key
  is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in
  whole or in part, and is kept secret, the resulting ciphertext is impossible
  to decrypt.
* salts - random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function
  that "hashes" a password or passphrase.

1. Pass statistical randomness tests
2. Hold up under serious attacks, including when the initial or running state
   becomes available to the attacker

* Next bit test
* State compromise extensions

???
  
next-bit test: given the first k bits of a random sequence, there is no
polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the (k+1)th bit with better than 50%
probability of success. A generator passing the next bit test will pass all
other polynomial time statistical tests for randomness.

state compromise extensions: if the state is revealed, it should be impossible
to reconstruct the stream of randoom numbers prior to the revelation. If there
is entropy input while running, it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the
input's state to predict future conditions of the CSPRNG state.

Pi is an interesting example: any state of pi passes the next-bit test, as pi
appears random, but knowing the state allows and attacker.
