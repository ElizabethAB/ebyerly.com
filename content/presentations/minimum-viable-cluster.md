Press `P` for presenter's notes.

A short presentation given at [Statistical Programming DC](http://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/),
which I hope to have an excuse to expand on. It was the framework for
introducing my side project, [rcluster](https://github.com/ElizabethAB/rcluster),
which is a tool for launching a minimum viable R cluster on AWS.
