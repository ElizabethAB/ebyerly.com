Press `P` for presenter's notes.

I originally gave this presentation at [Summit Consulting](http://www.summitllc.us/)
([evidence](https://twitter.com/EdDieterle/status/695662703789133826)). It was
half an excuse for me to research the PRNGs on which my analysis relies. I'd
love to have to dig this up with an opportunity to expand on non-statistical
uses.
