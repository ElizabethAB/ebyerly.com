summary: Basic data intake notes for DataFest 2016

[Data Intake: Defining, Cleaning and Merging]({filename}/presentations/data-intake-basic.html)

Press `P` for presenter's notes.

This presentation was developed to open [DC DataFest 2016](http://jpsm.umd.edu/event/asa-dc-datafest-2016),
as my small way to give participants an edge on what professional data intake
(i.e., wrestling with hideous data the first time you see it) looks like.
