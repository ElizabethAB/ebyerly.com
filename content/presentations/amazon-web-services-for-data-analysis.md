Slides: [Amazon Web Services for Data Analysis]({filename}/presentations/amazon-web-services-for-data-analysis.html)

[David Kretch](http://www.kretch.org/) and I originally gave this presentation
at [Summit Consulting](http://www.summitllc.us/). I've tweaked it slightly to
speak to a broader audience of data analysts, but the take-homes haven't
changed (and probably won't until AWS significantly changes its offerings).
