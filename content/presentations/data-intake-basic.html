  What do we do with new data?

  We need to look at it, define what we understand it to contain, clean it into
  a usable form, and merge it with other data to make it more useful.

We are going to talk about what it takes to make our data usable.

This presentation is short. We're looking to come in under 45 minutes, which
means we will not have time to cover granular detail.

I won't cover everything you need to know and I won't be including, "Here's how
to do this in R/Python/whatever" because you are working with all different
systems. My goal is to introduce the vocabulary and concepts you will need to
Google your way to success.

... only to be inevitably disappointed.

Look at the first ten rows of your data. Where possible, do it in a way that
won't impose transformations on your data (like opening a .csv file in a text
editor)

## {{ name }}

The file
* File size (100 MB? 100 GB?)
* File type (.csv, .RData, .xlsx)
* Date and time of creation (not reliable)

The data
* Number of observations (rows)
* Number of variables (columns)


---

name: Look at your data
class: 
## {{ name }}

Characters
* Encoding: `≤80` becomes `â‰¤80%`
* White space: `Bob_` versus `Bob _`
* Capitalization: `Summit` and `summit`

Numerics
* Stored with meaningful characters: `$100`, `50%`
* Scale: Is this `weight` variable in pounds or grams? (JK it's in stone)


---

name: Look at your data
class: 
## {{ name }}

Factors
* Factor v. character variables depends on your use case.
* Defining a variable as a factor is a way of indicating there are a finite and,
  at least potentially, known set of possible values.

Dates
* Date storage is worth an entire presentation
* "Zero day": 1970 vs. 1900
* ISO standard and everything else: "06/20/1989" vs. 1989-06-20

???

Linux counts the zero time as 1970-01-01, Excel as 1900-01-01. You should check
what your system uses.


---

name: Make a data dictionary
class: 
## {{ name }}

1. List all the data's variables
2. Write out your understanding of what each variable means
    * Record if you don't know what a variable means!
3. Record how each variable is stored, as far as you can tell (data type,
   scale, formatting, encoding)
4. When possible, confirm these notes with the data's source

???

Be ready to update your dictionary as you get a better understanding.

Now that we have a literal understanding of *what* our data is, we need to start
trying to understand what our data might be able to tell us.

EDA is the step where we try to discard our preconceived notions about what our
data will contain. Did someone tell you it has nationwide information? Okay,
but what if every observation is from Washington, DC?

Numerics can be bucketed into a categorical. Categorical variables may hide 
meaningful quantitative information, like eye shades. Some variables are obvious
about their dual status.

```
the_length_of_rope_connecting_points

**Make variable names short, descriptive, and coherent**

```
rope_length
rope_color
n_connections
```

???

Make your variable names something that will work across multiple statistical
packages (lower snack case, no punctuation marks). Try to pick your names to be
as short and descriptive as possible - short because you'll be typing it over
and over, descriptive so that someone can open up your code and read it as
though it were pseudo-code.

* Convert to a consistent and useful scale
* Consider trimming or containing outlier values

General rules are difficult. 

All clean data is alike. All dirty data is dirty in its own way.

Is the same value defined the same way every time?

* Imputation
* Deletion
* Recoding

???

Why are values missing? Is it random, does it represent a choice, does it encode
information? Is it corruption?

* Missing completely at random: missing y depends on neither x nor y
* Missing at random: missing y depends on x, but not y
* Missing not at random: probability of missing y depends on y

Which variables are missing? Is there missingness in all variables or is it
concentrated?

Is there a pattern in the missingness?

"Merging data" refers to joining two datasets in order to flesh out the total
breadth of information available to any given observation.


---

name: Unique keys
class: 
## {{ name }}

What defines a unique observation in your data?

* What *should* define a unique observation?
* What *actually* defines a unique observation?

<p align="middle" style="padding: 1em"><img src="images/data-intake-basic-id.jpg" height = 200 alt="https://globalprosperity.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ruthfremsonnytimes.jpg?w=307&h=205"></p>

???

A unique identifying key should be your name, parents' identities, and the date
and place of your birth. But people lie, or parents with twins decide to be
funny and name them both "George", so we use biometrics to uniquely ID humans
in contexts where we think veracity is critical.

You may have a column that says ID. It may or may not actually be an ID.
Check for uniqueness.
