Title: About Me

# Elizabeth Byerly

Data | Programming | Systems

I work as a systems architect and statistical programmer.

My statistical programming experience includes data ingestion and ETL, 
exploratory data analysis, modeling, and reporting. Systems architecture, 
including application programming, machine images, and networking, allows me to 
make statistical programming tasks distributed and scalable. Intuitive and fast 
architectures for data analysis means focusing on solving complex problems.

## Selected Work History

### Data Systems Architect

Summit Consulting, LLC - Washington, DC

June 2014 – Present

At Summit Consulting, I support the Litigation Directorate's quantitative expert 
witness services. I also act as a technical expert across Summit’s portfolio, 
providing consultation on cloud computing, distributed systems, big data, 
machine learning, databases, and version control. 

Project examples:

* Improved the runtime of a computationally intensive model from 180 hours to
  19 hours using parallelization and cloud resources. The reduced runtime made
  it feasible to update, and render more defensible, an econometric model 
  submitted as expert witness material in $20+ billion dollar litigation.
* Developed automated report generation, saving more than 25 skilled labor
  hours at each iteration of data and building in continuous quality control.
  Automation was accomplished using Python to interact with the AWS API, R 
  scripts, and Stata programs.
* Coordinated internal staff and external teaming partners' work on a shared
  cloud platform. A common working environment was provided seamlessly and
  securely using imaging, network management, and user access permissions.
* Researched, implemented, and reported on robust regression methods ultimately
  included as the method of choice in expert witness testimony.
* Rewrote a data ingestion pipeline, using shell utilities to improve processing
  time by orders of magnitude and avoiding conversion artifacts created by the 
  original process's unintended type enforcement.


### Invited Speaker

### SQL Coach

The New Organizing Institute - Washington, DC

April 2014

Provided one-on-one coaching on PostgreSQL, including training on the command 
line interface, syntax, database development, and database management. Students 
were guided through executing on simple use cases.
