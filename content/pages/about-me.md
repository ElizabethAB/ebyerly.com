Title: About Me

# Elizabeth Byerly

Data | Programming | Systems

I work as a systems architect and statistical programmer.

Systems architecture has meant collaborating with end users to design analytics
platforms that scale to their need, then using application programming, secure
networking, and sysadmin tools to develop and deploy that platform. My
statistical programming experience includes data ingestion and ETL, exploratory
data analysis, modeling, and reporting.

## Selected Work History

### Data Systems Architect

Summit Consulting, LLC - Washington, DC

June 2014 – Present

At Summit Consulting, I support the Litigation Directorate's quantitative expert 
witness services. I also act as a technical expert across Summit’s portfolio, 
providing consultation on cloud computing, distributed systems, big data, 
machine learning, databases, and version control. 

Project examples:

* Improved the runtime of a computationally intensive model from 180 hours to 19
  hours with parallelization on cloud resources, introducing cloud computing to
  the firm. The reduction made it feasible to update, and render more
  defensible, an econometric model submitted as expert witness material in $20+
  billion litigation.
* Transitioned internal staff and external teaming partners’ work onto a shared
  cloud platform to solve coordination and data sharing problems. The common
  working environment was provided seamlessly and securely using network
  controls, user access management, a network file system, imaging, and a hosted
  code repository.
* Automated report generation, saving more than 25 skilled labor hours at each
  iteration of data and incorporating continuous quality control, using Python
  to interact with AWS, R, and Stata.
* Researched, implemented, and reported on robust regression methods ultimately
  included as the method of choice in expert witness testimony.
* Rewrote a data ingestion pipeline using shell utilities, improving processing
  time by orders of magnitude and avoiding conversion artifacts from unintended
  type enforcement.
